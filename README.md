# Number-Guessing-Game


The "Number Guessing Game " is a Python application that provides an entertaining and educational experience for users. The game challenges players to guess a randomly generated number. There's modes including "Any Number," "Odd Number," and "Even Number," each altering the rules of the game for a diverse guessing experience. The application generates random numbers based on the selected mode, ensuring that for "Odd" and "Even" modes, the generated number adheres to the chosen mode's parity. Players have a limited number of attempts to guess the correct number, adding an element of challenge that can be customized by setting the maximum number of attempts. The game provides feedback on each guess, indicating whether it is correct, too high, or too low. Additionally, the application keeps track of the player's score, counting the attempts taken to guess the correct number. After completing a round, players have the option to play again, resetting the game and generating a new random number based on the selected mode. The application features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) created using the Tkinter library, ensuring accessibility and a visually appealing experience. To run the game, simply clone the repository, ensure Python 3.x and the Tkinter library are installed, and execute the application using a Python interpreter.
